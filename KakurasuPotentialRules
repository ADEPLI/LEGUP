Potential Direct/Basic Rules
1. CompleteSumRule
    a. There is only one way, given the previously filled cells, to mark the cells to reach the target sum
2. FillInEmptiesRule

Potential Contradiction Rules
1. ExceededSumRule/SumTooLargeRule
    a. If the sum of the row/column exceeds the target value, this path is invalid
    b. Could make it so even if the row/column isn't filled, the rule will still trigger as if the rest of the blank cells were empty
    c. Needs you to be able to select an entire row/column
2. IncompleteSumRule/SumTooSmallRule
    a. If the row/column is filled but the sum is not equal to the target sum, this path is invalid
    b. Could make it so even if the row/column isn't filled, the rule will still trigger as if the rest of the blank cells were filled
    c. Also needs you to be able to select an entire row/column

Potential Case Rules
